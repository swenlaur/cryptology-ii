\begin{exercise}{Separation of key-only and one-more signature attacks in the standard model}
Prove that security of a signature scheme can be
  never proved through a reduction that shows how to extract secret
  key from an adversary who is successful in deception. More
  precisely, show that if such a reduction exists then there exists
  also an attack strategy that extracts a secret key using few signing
  queries. Why this impossibility result does not conflict with the
  security proofs in the random oracle model?
